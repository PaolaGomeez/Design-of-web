# Personal website
This project is a personal website created with HTML and CSS. The page is structured into several sections: a header with the name, a main section with a biography, hobbies, and skills, and a footer with contact information and a copyright notice.

The header has a centered design using Flexbox. The footer maintains a consistent design, including contact information and a copyright notice.

The page is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Three types of CSS were used—internal, external, and inline—to create a design.
